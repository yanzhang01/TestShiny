PTENP1 | ESR1 | PMID: 29021233 |  PTENP1 upregulation decreases PTEN gene expression in the ER-positive MCF7 and T47D human breast carcinoma cells and accelerates MCF7 tumor growth in vivo. Of note, PTENP1 transduction significantly decreases ER&alpha; (ESR1) mRNA and protein levels in MCF7 xenografts with a concomitant increase in hsa-miR-26a, a miR known to target ESR1. In the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and C3HBA breast cancer cells upregulation of PTENP1 increases PTEN gene expression with no influence on hsa-miR-26a, ESR1 or ER&alpha; expression.

While PTENP1 transduction did not influence the growth rate of human MDA-MB-231 xenografts, PTENP1 upregulation profoundly reduces its metastatic propensity. Further, PTENP1 significantly inhibits the growth rate of ER-negative C3HBA murine breast cancer xenografts.
PTENP1 | GC | PMID: 28931965 |  Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) phosphatase and tensin homolog pseudogene 1 (PTENP1) is significantly downregulated in gastric cancer (GC), playing critical roles in GC progression. However, the association between PTENP1 genetic variants and GC risk has not yet been reported. Using TaqMan technology, three lncRNA PTENP1 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs7853346 C>G, rs865005 C>T, and rs10971638 G>A) were genotyped in 768 GC patients and 768 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population.
