PTENP1 : ESR1 : PMID: 29021233 : PTENP1 upregulation decreases PTEN gene expression in the ER-positive MCF7 andT47D human breast carcinoma cells and accelerates MCF7 tumor growth in vivo. Ofnote, PTENP1 transduction significantly decreases ERα (ESR1) mRNA and proteinlevels in MCF7 xenografts with a concomitant increase in hsa-miR-26a, a miR knownto target ESR1. In the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and C3HBA breast cancer cellsupregulation of PTENP1 increases PTEN gene expression with no influence onhsa-miR-26a, ESR1 or ERα expression.

While PTENP1 transduction did not influencethe growth rate of human MDA-MB-231 xenografts, PTENP1 upregulation profoundlyreduces its metastatic propensity. Further, PTENP1 significantly inhibits thegrowth rate of ER-negative C3HBA murine breast cancer xenografts.

PTENP1 : GC : PMID: 28931965 : Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) phosphatase and tensin homolog pseudogene 1 (PTENP1)is significantly downregulated in gastric cancer (GC), playing critical roles inGC progression. However, the association between PTENP1 genetic variants and GCrisk has not yet been reported. Using TaqMan technology, three lncRNA PTENP1 tagsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs7853346 C>G, rs865005 C>T, andrs10971638 G>A) were genotyped in 768 GC patients and 768 cancer-free controls ina Chinese population.
