IGHGP | ELK1 | PMID: 9089093 | Some of these sites showed tissue-specific methylation. 3' of the unmethylated CpG-rich sequences, clones derived from the 5' (telomeric) copy of the duplicated region, contained, in order, endogenous retroviral sequences, a processed ELK1 pseudogene, and the pseudogene IGHGP. Comparison with the presumed 3' (centromeric) copy of the duplicated region showed that similarity was lost exactly at the end of the retroviral long terminal repeat sequences.
RRM2P3 | MAOB | PMID: 7759098 | A 650-kb YAC containing the loci MAOA, MAOB, and NDP has been used as the starting point for a bidirectional chromosomal walk. A contig of 16 YACs covering between 2 and 3 Mb has been developed in which the following markers/genes are located (in physical order): Xpter--DXS1201 (256ze5)--DXS6668--DXS228--DXS77--MAOA--++ +MAOB--FR12 (pseudogene)--NDP--DXS6670--RRM2P3--DXS6671--DXS742 --Xcen. Seven new STSs are described both for end clones and for internal Alu PCR products from the contig.
CSTP2 | CST1 | PMID: 7896273 | The human type 2 cystatins are encoded by a multigene family of eight to nine members. Five functional genes (CST1-CST5) and two pseudogenes (CSTP1 and CSTP2) have previously been cloned. We have developed a panel of short genomic fragments that serve as gene-specific probes for these seven genes under hybridization conditions used for Southern blots or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Analysis of BssHII-digested genomic DNA using these probes was consistent with association of all seven genes with a 905-kb fragment, suggesting physical clustering at a single site.

CALCP | CALCB | PMID: 8468047 | Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We report the high-resolution localization of the human calcitonin/CGRP genes, CALCA, CALCB, and the pseudogene CALCP, to a 220-kb SacII fragment on chromosome 11p15.2-p15.

RAF1P1 | QDPR | PMID: 8096345 | Fifty-seven polymorphisms, representing 42 loci, were analyzed in the Venezuelan reference pedigree. The markers included seven genes (ADRA2C, ALB, GABRB1, GC, HOX7, IDUA, QDPR), one pseudogene (RAF1P1), and 34 anonymous DNA loci. Four loci were represented by microsatellite polymorphisms and one (GC) was expressed as a protein polymorphism.


HLA-H | HLA-A | PMID: 1362179 | This originally manifested itself as a haplotype-associated size variation in the NotI and MluI megabase fragments observed on pulsed-field electrophoresis gels after blotting and probing with HLA-A subregion-specific genomic probes. The contracted region falls between the HLA-A and the HLA-G class I genes and specifically includes the novel HLA-A-related pseudogene, HLA-H, as well as the adjacent deteriorated class I pseudogene, 7.0 p.

HLA-J | HLA-A | PMID: 1602142 | G. Ragoussis and co-workers (Genomics 4:301) previously described a class I HLA gene (now designated HLA-J) that maps to within 50 kb of HLA-A. The nucleotide sequences of three HLA-J alleles are reported here.


HLA-J | HLA-G | PMID: 1602142 | The nucleotide sequences of three HLA-J alleles are reported here. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of HLA-J alleles shows this gene is more related to HLA-G, A, and H than to HLA-B, C, E, and F. All four alleles of HLA-J are pseudogenes because of deleterious mutations that produce translation termination either in exon 2 or exon 4.


HLA-J | HLA-B | PMID: 1602142 | Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of HLA-J alleles shows this gene is more related to HLA-G, A, and H than to HLA-B, C, E, and F. All four alleles of HLA-J are pseudogenes because of deleterious mutations that produce translation termination either in exon 2 or exon 4. Apart from these mutations, the predicted proteins have structures similar to those of HLA-A, B, and C molecules.


HLA-H | HLA-A | PMID: 1602142 | There is, however, little polymorphism at HLA-J and none at functional positions of the Ag-recognition site. The polymorphism is less than found for HLA-H another HLA-A-related pseudogene. HLA-J appears, like HLA-H, to be an inactivated gene that result from duplication of an Ag-presenting locus related to HLA-A.


CSTP2 | CST5 | PMID: 1334620 | The CST4 clone contained the gene coding for the precursor form(141 amino acids) of cystatin S, and its exon-intron organization is the same as that of other members (the cystatin SN gene at the CST1 locus, the cystatin SA gene at the CST2 locus, the cystatin C gene at the CST3 locus and a cystatin pseudogene at the CSTP1 locus). The second cystatin pseudogene was elucidated in the clone, CST5, and it was assigned to the CSTP2 locus. Alignment of DNA sequences of cystatin genes with other genes suggested that the genes for cystatins, kininogens, and Bowman-Birk type inhibitors have evolved from an ancient ribonuclease-like gene.

HLA-H | HLA-B | PMID: 2294403 | A portion of this RNA begins at the transcription site predicted by analogy to certain class I cDNA clones, while another portion appears to begin shortly upstream. L cells transfected with a hybrid gene containing the first three exons of HLA-H and the last five exons of HLA-B27 accumulated full-length HLA transcripts at the same level as cells transfected with an HLA-B27 gene; both levels are at least 15- to 20-fold higher than that directed by HLA-H alone. In addition, we isolated a cDNA clone for HLA-H that contains a portion of intron 3 attached to a normally spliced sequence comprising exons 4 through 8.


MT2P1 | HP | PMID: 2873080 | In an earlier paper, positive but nonsignificant lod scores were found in pair-wise linkage tests between multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN-2A) and both the haptoglobin (HP) locus on chromosome 16 and group-specific component (GC) locus on chromosome 4. Recently discovered restriction fragment length polymorphisms for HP and for metallothionein 2 processed pseudogene 1 (MT2P1) near GC have made it possible to carry out a more powerful set of linkage tests with MEN-2A. This paper reports the results of such linkage analyses employing both pair-wise and multipoint tests.


MT2P1 | GC | PMID: 2873080 | Close linkage of HP on chromosome 16 and MEN-2A is excluded. Linkage of MEN-2A on chromosome 4 with GC is excluded on the MT2P1 side of GC in a 7-centimorgan interval around MT2P1. DOI: 10.
