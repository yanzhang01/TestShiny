This Shiny app is made by Yan Zhang. Data tables are generated by Shenglong Tan.  
This app is under development and refinement.

### Run the Shiny app of PgenePapers (beta version)

To run the app locally, you need to install R on your computer, and then install the **markdown**, **networkD3**, **DT** and **shiny** packages in R.  

Run the app in R:

```R
if (!require('markdown')) install.packages("markdown")
if (!require('networkD3')) install.packages("networkD3")
if (!require('DT')) install.packages("DT")
if (!require('shiny')) install.packages("shiny")
shiny::runGitHub("shiny_PgenePapers", "yanzhang01", subdir = "Beta_version")
```

Note: Sometimes "Downloading https://..." does not work if your computer is under a very restricted firewall: status was 'Couldn't connect to server'. Then you may switch to another secure network temporarily.  

### Database and Search Tools:

- **Pseudogene-Gene-Role Table** - Displays manually curated (based on compter generated results) pseudogene-coding gene regulation pairs, supports keyword search in the fly.

  Note: The keywords in **_Coding Gene Name_** starting with a * are not genes, but other associated risk, such as Gastric cancer (GC) risk.
- **All Papers** - Displays manually curated (based on computer generated results) pseudogene-coding gene regulation pairs, provides text from publications as a reference, supports keyword search in the fly. 

  Note: The keywords in **_Coding Gene Name_** starting with a * are not genes, but other associated risk, such as Gastric cancer (GC) risk.
- **Graph Presentation and Data Download** - The users can select one or all pseudogene(s) or genes (s) from the input lists, and generate an association network in the fly. Users can also download the filtered data corresponding to the graph. 

  Note: The keywords in **_Coding Gene Name_** starting with a * are not genes, but other associated risks, such as Gastric cancer (GC) risk.
- **Readme** - You are here.
