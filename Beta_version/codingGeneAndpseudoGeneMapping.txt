PTENP1 | ESR1 | PMID: 29021233 | PTENP1 upregulation decreases PTEN gene expression in the ER-positive MCF7 and T47D human breast carcinoma cells and accelerates MCF7 tumor growth in vivo. Of note, PTENP1 transduction significantly decreases ERÎ± (ESR1) mRNA and protein levels in MCF7 xenografts with a concomitant increase in hsa-miR-26a, a miR known to target ESR1. In the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and C3HBA breast cancer cells upregulation of PTENP1 increases PTEN gene expression with no influence on hsa-miR-26a, ESR1 or ERÎ± expression.

PTENP1 | ESR1 | PMID: 29021233 | In the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and C3HBA breast cancer cells upregulation of PTENP1 increases PTEN gene expression with no influence on hsa-miR-26a, ESR1 or ERÎ± expression. While PTENP1 transduction did not influence the growth rate of human MDA-MB-231 xenografts, PTENP1 upregulation profoundly reduces its metastatic propensity. Further, PTENP1 significantly inhibits the growth rate of ER-negative C3HBA murine breast cancer xenografts.

PTENP1 | GC | PMID: 28931965 | Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) phosphatase and tensin homolog pseudogene 1 (PTENP1) is significantly downregulated in gastric cancer (GC), playing critical roles in GC progression. However, the association between PTENP1 genetic variants and GC risk has not yet been reported. Using TaqMan technology, three lncRNA PTENP1 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs7853346 C>G, rs865005 C>T, and rs10971638 G>A) were genotyped in 768 GC patients and 768 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population.

DUXAP8 | GC | PMID: 28881724 | In this paper, we report that a newly discovered pseudogene-derived lncRNA named DUXAP8, a 2107-bp RNA, was remarkably upregulated in GC. Additionally, a higher level of DUXAP8 expression in GC was significantly associated with greater tumor size, advanced clinical stage, and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with a higher level of DUXAP8 expression had a relatively poor prognosis.

DUXAP8 | GC | PMID: 28881724 | Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DUXAP8 could epigenetically suppress the expression of PLEKHO1 by binding to EZH2 and SUZ12 (two key components of PRC2), thus promoting GC development. Taken together, our findings suggest that the pseudogene-derived lncRNA DUXAP8 promotes the progression of GC and is a potential therapeutic target for GC intervention. DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.

PTENP1 | SOCS6 | PMID: 28731203 | Subsequent IHC reported a similar trend in human ESCC samples. 3'UTR luciferase assay demonstrated that PTENP1 3'UTR decoyed miR-17-5p from binding to SOCS6. Moreover, PTENP1 expression was correlated with clinicopathological indicators to varying degrees, including histological grade, TNM stage, infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival.

PTTG3P | GC | PMID: 28631396 | Pseudogenes play a crucial role in cancer progression. However, the role of pituitary tumour-transforming 3, pseudogene (PTTG3P) in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. Here, we showed that PTTG3P expression was abnormally up-regulated in GC tissues compared with that in normal tissues both in our 198 cases of clinical samples and the cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.

PTTG3P | GC | PMID: 28631396 | High PTTG3P expression was correlated with increased tumour size and enhanced tumour invasiveness and served as an independent negative prognostic predictor. Moreover, up-regulation of PTTG3P in GC cells stimulated cell proliferation, migration and invasion both in vitro in cell experiments and in vivo in nude mouse models, and the pseudogene functioned independently of its parent genes. Overall, these results reveal that PTTG3P is a novel prognostic biomarker with independent oncogenic functions in GC. Â© 2017 The Authors.

BNIP3P1 | HK2 | PMID: 28618048 | We revealed that decidual gene transcription profile was altered in severe PE and identified 293 key PE-related genes involved in 19 differentially regulated pathways relevant for the pathogenesis of PE, among which ENO2, PGK1, and HK2 involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and HIF-1 signaling pathway which are all highly related with tumorigenesis and are significantly upregulated in cancer cells were severely inhibited in the decidua of PE. Moreover, we identified 22 core regulatory genes, including the newly identified pseudogenes BNIP3P1, HK2P1, and PGK1P1 that encode long non-coding RNA (lncRNA); interestingly, BNIP3/BNIP3P1, HK2/HK2P1, and PGK1/PGK1P1 appear in pairs in core genes. Subsequent analyses using quantitative PCR validated a portion of these results.

CKS1BP7 | IGF1R | PMID: 28439706 | 01). Within the same tumors, identical CNAs of CKS1BP7 and IGF1R were found in DCIS and invasive carcinoma. Moreover, amplification of both genes was more frequent in aneuploidy tumors and the tumors with high ki67, but wasn't associated with patients' outcome.

CKS1BP7 | IGF1R | PMID: 28439706 | Moreover, amplification of both genes was more frequent in aneuploidy tumors and the tumors with high ki67, but wasn't associated with patients' outcome. In summary, CKS1BP7 amplification is a frequent event in breast cancer and often co-occurs with amplified IGF1R, which provides evidence supporting the interactions between CKS1BP7 and IGF1R during mammary carcinogenesis. Our findings suggest that CKS1BP7 as well as IGF1R may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection and predict prognosis in breast cancer. DOI: 10.

CYP4Z2P | CYP4Z1 | PMID: 28236635 | Epub 2017 Mar 16. The competing endogenous RNA network of CYP4Z1 and pseudogene CYP4Z2P exerts an anti-apoptotic function in breast cancer. Li C(1)(2), Zheng L(1)(2), Xin Y(1)(2), Tan Z(1)(2), Zhang Y(1)(2), Meng X(1)(2), Wang Z(3), Xi T(1)(2). Author information: (1)School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China. (2)Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China. (3)College of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China. The competing endogenous RNA network (ceRNET) is involved in tumorigenesis and has become a hot spot of research. The ceRNET between CYP4Z1 and the pseudogene CYP4Z2P promotes angiogenesis and mediates tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. Nevertheless, the effects of this ceRNET on cell apoptosis and related mechanisms remain unclear.

PTENP1 | GC | PMID: 28212532 | However, whether a PTENP1~miRNA~PTEN ceRNA network exists and how it functions in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. In order to identify and characterize the PTENP1~miRNA~PTEN ceRNA network in GC, we first determined PTENP1 levels in clinical GC samples and found that PTENP1 and PTEN were concurrently downregulated in these samples. We further demonstrated that PTENP1 could act as a ceRNA to sponge miR-106b and miR-93 from targeting PTEN for downregulation using a novel ceRNA in vitro gradient assay.

TFAMP1 | PSMG3 | PMID: 27866770 | Both CpGs, in turn, were associated with decreased risk of asthma at 18years of age. Cg14472551 is located in an intron of KIAA1549L, whose protein binds to a B-cell commitment transcription factor; cg01669161 is located between an antisense regulator of the proteasome assembly chaperone PSMG3, and TFAMP1, a pseudogene. Increased methylation of cg01669161 was also associated with decreased serum IgE levels. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation changes following tetanus vaccination may offer a novel prospect to explain a differential occurrence of asthma in adolescence. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2016 The Author(s).

NMRAL2P | NQO1 | PMID: 27860235 | This noncoding RNA was confirmed as a novel functional pseudogene for NmrA-like redox sensor 1, and was given the name NmrA-like redox sensor 2 pseudogene (NMRAL2P). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments corroborated the presence of Nrf2 interactions on the NMRAL2P genomic region, and interestingly, NMRAL2P also served as a coregulator of NQO1 in human colon cancer cells. Silencing of NMRAL2P via CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing protected against SFN-mediated inhibition of cancer cell growth, colony formation, and migration. CONCLUSION: NMRAL2P is the first functional pseudogene to be identified both as a direct transcriptional target of Nrf2, and as a downstream regulator of Nrf2-dependent NQO1 induction.

MORF4 | TCEAL1 | PMID: 27506666 | 2, this gene is not included in our patient's microdeletion and is not dysregulated by a position effect. Because the microdeletion encompasses only three genes, GLRA4, MORF4L2 and TCEAL1, we investigated their expression levels in various tissues by RT-qPCR and found that all three genes were highly expressed in whole human brain, fetal brain, cerebellum and hippocampus. When we examined the transcript levels of GLRA4, MORF4L2 as well as TCEAL1 in DGDP084's family, however, only GLRA4 transcripts were reduced in the female patient compared to her healthy mother.

When we examined the transcript levels of GLRA4, MORF4L2 as well as TCEAL1 in DGDP084's family, however, only GLRA4 transcripts were reduced in the female patient compared to her healthy mother. This suggests that GLRA4 is the plausible candidate gene for cognitive impairment, behavioral problems and craniofacial anomalies observed in DGDP084. Importantly, glycine receptors mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain stem as well as the spinal cord, and are known to be involved in syndromic intellectual disability. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that GLRA4 is involved in intellectual disability, behavioral problems and craniofacial anomalies as the second gene identified for X-linked syndromic intellectual disability at Xq22.

CYP4Z2P | CYP4Z1 | PMID: 26980484 | In detail, many miRNAs have been associated with breast cancer tamoxifen resistance, but no studies have addressed the role of miRNA-mediated competitive endogenous RNAs network (ceRNET) in tamoxifen resistance. The ceRNET between CYP4Z1 and pseudogene CYP4Z2P has been revealed to promote breast cancer angiogenesis. However, its function in tamoxifen resistance remains unclear.

TaqManâ„?genotyping assays are widely used to genotype CYP2D6, which encodes a major drug metabolizing enzyme. Assay design for CYP2D6 can be challenging owing to the presence of two pseudogenes, CYP2D7 and CYP2D8, structural and copy number variation and numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) some of which reflect the wild-type sequence of the CYP2D7 pseudogene.

Genotype and gene resequencing of CYP2D6 and CYP2D7-specific XL-PCR products revealed a CC>GT dinucleotide SNP in exon 1 of CYP2D7 that reverts the sequence to CYP2D6 and allows a TaqMan assay PCR primer to bind. Because CYP2D7 also carries a Tins, a false-positive mutation signal is generated.

FER1L4 | PTEN | PMID: 26306906 | We observed that FER1L4 was downregulated in gastric cancer and that its level corresponded with that of PTEN mRNA. Both FER1L4 and PTEN mRNA were targets of miR-106a-5p. Further experiments demonstrated that FER1L4 downregulation liberates miR-106a-5p and decreases the abundances of PTEN mRNA and protein.

PPP1R26P1 | RB1 | PMID: 26275142 | Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. The human RB1 gene is imprinted due to integration of the PPP1R26P1 pseudogene into intron 2. PPP1R26P1 harbors the gametic differentially methylated region of the RB1 gene, CpG85, which is methylated in the female germ line.

PPP1R26P1 | RB1 | PMID: 26275142 | The paternally unmethylated CpG85 acts as promoter for the alternative transcript 2B of RB1, which interferes with expression of full-length RB1 in cis. In mice, PPP1R26P1 is not present in the Rb1 gene and Rb1 is not imprinted. Assuming that the mechanisms responsible for genomic imprinting are conserved, we investigated if imprinting of mouse Rb1 can be induced by transferring human PPP1R26P1 into mouse Rb1.

CONTEXT: The contiguous gene deletion syndrome (CAH-X) was described in a subset (7%) of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) patients with a TNXA/TNXB chimera, resulting in deletions of CYP21A2, encoding 21-hydroxylase necessary for cortisol biosynthesis, and TNXB, encoding the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-X (TNX). This TNXA/TNXB chimera is characterized by a 120-bp deletion in exon 35 and results in TNXB haploinsufficiency, disrupted TGF-Î² signaling, and an Ehlers Danlos syndrome phenotype. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the genetic status of TNXB and resulting protein defects in CAH patients with a CAH-X phenotype but not the previously described TNXA/TNXB chimera.

TNXA | TNXB | PMID: 26075496 | 5%. This highly conserved pseudogene-derived variant in the TNX fibrinogen-like domain is predicted to be deleterious and disulfide bonded, results in reduced dermal elastin and fibrillin-1 staining and altered TGF-Î²1 binding, and represents a novel TNXA/TNXB chimera. Tenascin-X protein expression was normal in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting a dominant-negative effect. CONCLUSIONS: CAH-X syndrome is commonly found in CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and may result from various etiological mechanisms. DOI: 10.

PTENP1 | GC | PMID: 25968876 | In this study, we demonstrated that PTENP1 was frequently decreased in GC tissues and cell lines, which might be partly associated with DNA hypermethylation, and lower PTENP1 expression was associated with larger tumor size, more advanced stage, deeper invasion depth and lymphatic metastasis. In addition, our data suggested that PTENP1 could regulate GC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PTENP1 could modulate the PTEN protein expression.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 27896104 | Approximately 90% of the classic forms of CAH, salt-wasting and simple virilizing, are due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. These include single nucleotide changes, insertions, deletions, as well as chimeric genes involving CYP21A2 and its highly homologous pseudogene CYP21A1P. A novel loci-specific PCR approach was developed to individually amplify the CYP21A2 gene, the nearby CYP21A1P pseudogene, as well as any 30Â kb deletion and gene conversion mutations, if present, as single separate amplicons.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 24799024 | Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder mainly caused by defects in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2), coding for the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OH). About 95% of the mutations arise from gene conversion between CYP21A2 and the inactive pseudogene CYP21A1P: only 5% are novel CYP21A2 mutations, in which functional analysis of mutant enzymes has been helpful to correlate genotype-phenotype. In the present study, we describe 3 novel point mutations (p.

TRPC2 | ZP3 | PMID: 24756702 | The major demonstrated functions of TRPC2 are regulation of pheromone-evoked signaling in the rodent VNO, regulation of erythropoietin-stimulated calcium influx in murine erythroid cells, and ZP3-evoked calcium influx into sperm. Depletion of TRPC2 in knockout mice resulted in changes in behavior including altered sex discrimination and lack of male-male aggression. The red cells of TRPC2 knockout mice showed increased mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and hematocrit and reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.

PPP1R26P1 | RB1 | PMID: 24019952 | The human retinoblastoma gene (RB1) is imprinted; the mouse Rb1 gene is not. Imprinted expression of RB1 is due to differential methylation of a CpG island (CpG85), which is located in the pseudogene PPP1R26P1 in intron 2 of RB1. CpG85 serves as promoter for an alternative RB1 transcript, which is expressed from the unmethylated paternal allele only and is thought to suppress expression of the full-length RB1 transcript in cis.

To determine the influence of PPP1R26P1 on RB1 expression, we generated an in vitro murine embryonic stem cell model by introducing human PPP1R26P1 into mouse Rb1. Next generation bisulfite sequencing of CpG85 and CpG42 revealed differences in their susceptibility to DNA methylation, gaining methylation at a median level of 4% and 18%, respectively. We showed binding of RNA polymerase II at and transcription from the unmethylated CpG85 in PPP1R26P1 and observed reduced expression of full-length Rb1 from the targeted allele.

To investigate the function of SERPINA2, we used HeLa cells stably transduced with the different variants of SERPINA2 and SERPINA1 (M1, S and Z) and leukocytes as the in vivo model. We identified SERPINA2 as a 52 kDa intracellular glycoprotein, which is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), independently of the variant analyzed.

We resequenced the coding and noncoding regions of the two adult Î²-globin genes (HBD and HBB) in European and African populations, and analyzed the data from the Î²-globin cluster (HBE, HBG2, HBG1, HBBP1, HBD, and HBB) in 1,092 individuals representing 14 populations sequenced as part of the 1000 Genomes Project. Additionally, we assessed the diversity levels in nonhuman primates using chimpanzee sequence data provided by the PanMap Project.

HBBP1 | HBD | PMID: 23431002 | Additionally, we assessed the diversity levels in nonhuman primates using chimpanzee sequence data provided by the PanMap Project. Comprehensive analyses, based on classic neutrality tests, empirical and haplotype-based studies, revealed that HBD and its neighbor pseudogene HBBP1 have mainly evolved under purifying selection, suggesting that their roles are essential and nonredundant. Moreover, in the light of recent studies on the chromatin conformation of the Î²-globin cluster, we present evidence sustaining that the strong functional constraints underlying the decreased contemporary diversity at these two regions were not driven by protein function but instead are likely due to a regulatory role in ontogenic switches of gene expression.

SIGLEC16 | SIGLEC11 | PMID: 22383531 | Here, we show that Siglec-11 is expressed exclusively in microglia in all human brains studied-a finding of potential relevance to brain evolution, as microglia modulate neuronal survival, and Siglec-11 recruits SHP-1, a tyrosine phosphatase that modulates microglial biology. Following the recent finding of a functional SIGLEC16 allele in human populations, further analysis of the human SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC16/P sequences revealed an unusual series of gene conversion events between two loci. Two tandem and likely simultaneous gene conversions occurred from SIGLEC16P to SIGLEC11 with a potentially deleterious intervening short segment happening to be excluded. One of the conversion events also changed the 5' untranslated sequence, altering predicted transcription factor binding sites.

SIGLEC16 | SIGLEC11 | PMID: 22383531 | In keeping with this, recombinant soluble Siglec-11 binds ligands in the human brain. We also address a second-round more recent gene conversion from SIGLEC11 to SIGLEC16, with the latter showing an allele frequency of ~0.1-0.

SIGLEC16 | SIGLEC11 | PMID: 22383531 | 3 in a worldwide population study. Initial pseudogenization of SIGLEC16 was estimated to occur at least 3 Ma, which thus preceded the gene conversion of SIGLEC11 by SIGLEC16P. As gene conversion usually disrupts the converted gene, the fact that ORFs of hSIGLEC11 and hSIGLEC16 have been maintained after an unusual series of very complex gene conversion events suggests that these events may have been subject to hominin-specific selection forces.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 22313422 | PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed neonatal dried blood spots from 753 subjects with transiently elevated levels of 17-OHP. The CYP21A2 gene was sequenced to detect point mutations, and the presence of CYP21A2 was further confirmed by two methods utilizing the difference between CYP21A2 and its CYP21A1P pseudogene in the sequence of exon 3 (8-bp deletion). The accuracy of the methods was verified using samples from 70 subjects with known CYP21A2 mutations and 181 healthy children. RESULT: Among the 701 successfully sequenced samples from subjects with transiently elevated 17-OHP, 670 (95%) had no point mutations or novel variants in the CYP21A2 gene.

Most CYP21A2 mutations result from intergenic recombinations between CYP21A2 and the closely linked CYP21A1P pseudogene. Rare mutations not generated by gene conversion account for only 5% to 10% of 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles.

NATP | NAT1 | PMID: 21995608 | AIMS: We have characterized nucleotide variation at the NAT1 and NAT2 genes, and at the NATP1 pseudogene in global human populations, including many previously under-represented African populations, in order to identify potential functional variants and to understand the role that natural selection has played in shaping variation at these loci in globally diverse populations. MATERIALS & METHODS: We have resequenced approximately 2800 bp for each of the NAT1 and NAT2 gene regions, as well as the pseudogene NATP1, in 197 African and 132 nonAfrican individuals. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: We observe a signature of balancing selection maintaining variation in the 3'-UTR of NAT1, suggesting that these variants may play a functional role that is currently undefined. In addition, we observed high levels of nonsynonymous functional variation at the NAT2 locus that differs amongst ethnically diverse populations. DOI: 10.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 21912141 | es BACKGROUND/AIMS: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders. Unequal crossing over or gene conversion between the active CYP21A2 gene and the inactive CYP21A1P pseudogene accounts for 95% of mutations, but many non-pseudogene-derived mutations have been described. It is important for these new mutations to be assigned to a specific phenotype. CASE REPORT AND RESULTS: We report a young boy diagnosed with the classical simple virilizing phenotype in whom the CYP21A2 genetic analysis disclosed that he was a compound heterozygous for p.

CYP2D7 | CYP2D6 | PMID: 21670550 | jp The human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of about 25% of commonly used therapeutic drugs. CYP2D6 belongs to the CYP2D subfamily, a gene cluster located on chromosome 22, which comprises the CYP2D6 gene and pseudogenes CYP2D7P and CYP2D8P. Although the chemical and physiological properties of CYP2D6 have been extensively studied, there has been no study to date on molecular evolution of the CYP2D subfamily in the human genome.

CYP2D8P | CYP2D6 | PMID: 21670550 | Here, we conducted a preliminary study to investigate the evolution and gene organization of the CYP2D subfamily, focused on humans and four non-human primates (chimpanzees, orangutans, rhesus monkeys, and common marmosets). Our results indicate that CYP2D7P has been duplicated from CYP2D6 before the divergence between humans and great apes, whereas CYP2D6 and CYP2D8P have been already present in the stem lineages of New World monkeys and Catarrhini. Furthermore, the origin of the CYP2D subfamily in the human genome can be traced back to before the divergence between amniotes and amphibians.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 21324303 | 7-kb TaqI-produced fragment of the CYP21A2-like gene and one duplicated CYP21A2 gene. We conclude that the pseudogene of the CYP21A1P mutation presents diverse variants. Moreover, the existence of the CYP21A2-like gene is more abundant than that of the duplicated CYP21A2 gene downstream of the XA gene and could not be distinguished from the CYP21A2-TNXB gene; thus, it may be misdiagnosed by previously established methods for congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by a 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 21164261 | Misalignment followed by unequal crossing over as well as gene conversion events result in a high degree of variation in gene copy number as well as gene sequence in this genomic region. The presence of a highly homologous pseudogene, CYP21A1P, forms the basis for the relatively high incidence of 21- hydroxylase deficiency as deleterious sequences can be transferred from CYP21A1P to CYP21A2. Despite the complexity of the locus, safe approaches for genotyping are established, and genotype phenotype relationships have been documented making genotyping a valuable complement to biochemical investigations in the diagnostics of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 21148302 | Because of the lack of a comprehensive study providing useful information about the detailed genetic structure of CYP21A1P, we used a large data set to analyze and characterize this pseudogene. METHODS: We amplified and directly sequenced the CYP21A1P and CYP21A2 genes of 200 unrelated individuals. The resulting sequence data were aligned against the manually curated transcript ENST0000448314 from Havana/Vega matching to the genebuild ENSG00000198457; all differences were documented.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 21148302 | RESULTS: We found that 40 potentially variable positions in CYP21A2 were conserved in CYP21A1P in all study participants. In addition, we detected 14 CYP21A1P variants that were not previously reported in either CYP21A2 or CYP21A1P. Unlike CYP21A2, CYP21A1P possessed certain mutation haplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic structure of CYP21A1P and the potential risks of false conclusions it may introduce are essential considerations in designing a PCR-based diagnosis procedure for congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Author information: (1)University Hospital Brno, Centre of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Czech Republic. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) comprises a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by an enzymatic deficiency which impairs the biosynthesis of cortisol and, in the majority of severe cases, also the biosynthesis of aldosterone. Approximately 95% of all CAH cases are caused by mutations in the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).

OR2B8P | OR1F1 | PMID: 20547194 | Thirteen novel OR variants were found through direct DNA sequencing and cloning, in addition to the detection of OR polymorphisms already known, and the number of OR cluster haplotypes could be increased to 21. Two loci belonging to the telomeric cluster (OR2B8P and OR1F12) were found to exhibit nonfunctional and potentially functional alleles and should therefore be considered as segregating pseudogenes. The results provide a detailed picture regarding polymorphisms and phenotypic variation in an ethnically diverse sample of major histocompatibility complex-linked OR clusters and identify a subregion of unusually pronounced genetic variability. We expand these data by analyzing linkage disequilibrium both within these OR clusters as well as between them and the HLA complex in 11 unrelated HapMap populations.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 20482300 | CYP21A2 is an active gene and encodes for the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme, whereas CYP21A1P is an inactive pseudogene that contains a series of deleterious mutations. The major part of disease-causing mutations in CYP21A2 alleles are CYP21A1P-derived sequence transferred to the active gene by macro or microconversion events. Approximately 5% of all disease-causing CYP21A2 alleles harbour rare mutations that do not originate from the pseudogene.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 19925038 | More than 90% of patients with CAH have mutations in CYP21A2 or have large deletions in the RCCX module on chromosome 6p21.3, which also includes the pseudogene CYP21A1P. Genotyping of CYP21A2 is required for diagnosis of CAH, but current genotyping methods, such as direct sequencing, allele-specific PCR amplification, or PCR amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) still need further improvements to reduce test time and cost. METHODS: We developed a novel CAH mutation screening method based on allele-specific primer extension (ASPE), followed by bead-array hybridization, for the ten major point mutation sites and the 8 bp deletion in CYP21A2, and a long PCR assay to detect large deletions between CYP21A1P and CYP21A2.

This novel genotyping strategy is superior to PCR-RFLP-based methods and equally as accurate as sequencing. DOI: 10.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 19263525 | In the prenatal diagnosis study, the MLPA assay was able to identify the presence of a CYP21A2 gene duplication in the fetus, as well in other two family members. CONCLUSION: MLPA analysis represents a simple, rapid and sensitive tool for the detection of CYP21A2/CYP21A1P deletions/duplications in CAH molecular diagnosis. Compared to Southern blot, MLPA may be considered a high throughput analysis, allowing the simultaneous study of several samples in the same experiment and the investigation of both gene (CYP21A2) and pseudogene (CYP21A1P) in each patient.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 19228439 | The significant advances in molecular biology and gene analysis over the past 2 decades have led to the development of novel sensitive methods of DNA analysis and study, including polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. Thus it has been revealed that the 21-OH gene (CYP21A2) and its nonfunctional pseudogene (CYP21A1P) are located on chromosome 6 (6p21.3), sharing a high homology of about 98%.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 19152428 | CYP21A2 is an active gene and encodes for the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme, whereas CYP21A1P is an inactive pseudogene that contains a series of deleterious mutations. The major part of disease- causing mutations in CYP21A2 alleles are CYP21A1P-derived sequence transferred to the active gene by macro or microconversion events. Only around 5% of all disease-causing CYP21A2 alleles harbour rare mutations that do not originate from the pseudogene.

KIR2DP1 | KIR3DL3 | PMID: 19000141 | All 16 KIR genes were observed in all four populations. Variation in GFs between populations was observed, except for KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3, KIR2DP1 and KIR3DP1 genes, which were present in every individual tested. When comparing KIR GFs between populations, both principal component analysis and a phylogenetic tree showed close clustering of the Kalimantan and Javanese populations, while Irianese populations were clearly separated from the other three populations.

SIGLEC16 | DAP | PMID: 18629938 | 200738078. SIGLEC16 encodes a DAP12-associated receptor expressed in macrophages that evolved from its inhibitory counterpart SIGLEC11 and has functional and non-functional alleles in humans. Cao H(1), Lakner U, de Bono B, Traherne JA, Trowsdale J, Barrow AD. Author information: (1)Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Wellcome Trust/MRC Building, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglec) are important components of immune recognition. The organization of Siglec genes in different species is consistent with rapid selection imposed by pathogens.

SIGLEC16 | SIGLEC11 | PMID: 18629938 | We studied SIGLEC11 genes in human, rodent, dog, cow and non-human primates. The lineages of SIGLEC11 genes in these species have undergone dynamic gene duplication and conversion, forming a potential inhibitory (SIGLEC11)/activating (SIGLEC16) receptor pair in chimpanzee and humans. A cDNA encoding human Siglec-16, currently classed as a pseudogene in the databases (SIGLECP16), is expressed in various cell lines and tissues.

NUDT9P1 | GFRA2 | PMID: 18521090 | SNPs associated with iloperidone efficacy were identified within the neuronal PAS domain protein 3 gene (NPAS3), close to a translocation breakpoint site previously observed in a family with schizophrenia. Five other loci were identified that include the XK, Kell blood group complex subunit-related family, member 4 gene (XKR4), the tenascin-R gene (TNR), the glutamate receptor, inotropic, AMPA 4 gene (GRIA4), the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha2 gene (GFRA2), and the NUDT9P1 pseudogene located in the chromosomal region of the serotonin receptor 7 gene (HTR7). The study of these polymorphisms and genes may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of schizophrenia and of its treatment.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 17666484 | Epub 2007 Jul 31. Microconversion between CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P promoter regions causes the nonclassical form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. AraÃºjo RS(1), Mendonca BB, Barbosa AS, Lin CJ, Marcondes JA, Billerbeck AE, Bachega TA. Author information: (1)Unidade de Endocrinologia do Desenvolvimento e Laboratorio de Hormonios e Genetica Molecular, Disciplina de Endocrinologia, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, SP 05403-900, Brazil. CONTEXT: Most mutations causing 21-hydroxylase deficiency originate from microconversions between CYP21 pseudogenes and active genes. However, around 20% of the alleles in the nonclassical form (NC-21OHD) remain without identified mutations, suggesting the involvement of regulatory regions.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 17666484 | EMSA demonstrated that the -132/-121 region is important for the DNA interaction with the specificity protein-1 transcription factor. CONCLUSION: Microconversions between CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P promoters could be involved in the nonclassical phenotype. Therefore CYP21A2 promoter analysis should be included in genetic studies of 21OHD. DOI: 10.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 17573904 | DESIGN AND METHODS: Sequence analysis of the entire CYP21A2 gene followed by molecular modelling was performed in three unrelated classical CAH patients of northeastern Iranian origin. The active (CYP21A2) and pseudogene (CYP21A1P) alleles were screened for the presence of the new variations in controls. RESULTS: Two novel missense mutations, F404S in exon 9 and T450P in exon 10, were found in homozygous forms in two female patients with a salt-wasting (SW) phenotype. These novel variants were screened by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and excluded in 100 unrelated normal alleles.

CRYBB2P1 | CRYBB1 | PMID: 17234267 | MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of the causative mutation in the ADC53 family. RESULTS: The ADC locus mapped to chromosome 22 in the region of a cluster of lens beta crystallin genes (CRYBB3, CRYBB2, CRYBB1, and CRYBA4 and the pseudogene CRYBB2P1). We sequenced CRYBB1 and CRYBB2 and found a previously reported mutation and a variant in exon 6 of CRYBB2 that cosegregate with the disease; these changes in CRYBB2 are in the reference (normal) sequence of an adjacent gene CRYBB2P1, a pseudogene.

XKRY | PRY | PMID: 17183480 | VCY, HSFY and RBMY were found to have functional X gametologs, but the rest did not. Using chimpanzee orthologs for XKRY, CDY, HSFY, PRY, and TSPY, the average silent substitution is estimated as 0.017 +/- 0.

XKRY | BPY2 | PMID: 17183480 | Except for VCY, all other loci possess two or more pseudogenes on the Y chromosome. Sequence differences from functional genes show that BPY2, DAZ, XKRY, and RBMY each have one pseudogene for each one that is human specific, while others were generated well before the human-chimpanzee split, by means of duplication, retro-transposition or translocation. Some functional MSY gene duplication of VCY, CDY and HSFY, as well as X-linked VCX and HSFX duplication, occurred in the lineage leading to humans; these duplicates have accumulated nucleotide substitutions that permit their identification.

SERPINA2 | SERPINA1 | PMID: 17135331 | 1 SERPIN subcluster, together with the highly homologous alpha1-antitrypsin-like sequence (SERPINA2), which was previously proposed to be a pseudogene. Here, we performed a resequencing study encompassing both SERPINA1 and SERPINA2 as well as the adjacent gene coding for corticosteroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6) in samples from Europe and West Africa. In the African sample, we found that a common haplotype carrying a 2-kb deletion in the SERPINA2 gene is associated with remarkable long-range homozygozity as if it was quickly driven to high frequency by natural selection acting on an advantageous variant.

ABCA17P | ABCA3 | PMID: 16968533 | Surprisingly, we found that both genes overlap at their first exons and are transcribed from opposite strands. This genomic colocalization and the observation that the ABCA17P and ABCA3 genes share significant homologies in several exons (up to 98%) suggest that both genes have evolved by gene duplication. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that ABCA17P and ABCA3 form a complex of overlapping genes in the human genome from which both non-coding and protein-coding ABC A-transporter RNAs are expressed. The fact that both genes overlap at their 5' ends suggests interdependencies in their regulation and may have important implications for the functional analysis of the disease gene ABCA3.

HYALP1 | SPAM1 | PMID: 16925524 | 2007 Jan 1;401(1):79-85. Mouse testicular hyaluronidase-like proteins SPAM1 and HYAL5 but not HYALP1 degrade hyaluronan. Reitinger S(1), Laschober GT, Fehrer C, Greiderer B, Lepperdinger G. Author information: (1)The Extracellular Matrix Research Group, Institute for Biomedical Aging Research, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Rennweg 10, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. Besides SPAM1 (sperm adhesion molecule 1; formerly named PH-20), further hyaluronidase-like proteins, HYAL5 (hyaluronoglucosaminidase 5) and HYALP1 (hyaluronoglucosaminidase pseudogene 1) are also expressed in murine testicular tissue. As they share a high degree of sequence similarity with known hyaluronidases, all three polypeptides could potentially exhibit hyaluronidase activity, a function that is beneficial for spermatozoa in order to penetrate the hyaluronan-rich cumulus, which surrounds the oocyte.

HYALP1 | SPAM1 | PMID: 16925524 | 277, 30310-30314]. We have now recombinantly expressed mouse SPAM1, HYAL5 and HYALP1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and determined their respective expression pattern in testis. Transcripts of all three genes are expressed in seminiferous tubules in regions where maturing spermatogenic cells reside.

HYALP1 | SPAM1 | PMID: 16925524 | Transcripts of all three genes are expressed in seminiferous tubules in regions where maturing spermatogenic cells reside. SPAM1 and HYAL5 but not HYALP1 proteins exhibit hyaluronidase activity at neutral pH. The two active hyaluronidases are both bound to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.

INGX | ING1 | PMID: 16792758 | RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, we found no somatic p33ING1b mutations in our panel of melanomas. We found that some of the discrepancy between our results and previously published studies may be due to inadvertent amplification of the ING1 pseudogene (INGX), and/or contamination of some samples with murine Ing1. CONCLUSIONS: p33ING1b mutations in melanoma are rare. We have highlighted the importance of allele-specific primer design to avoid pseudogene amplification, and also the necessity to confirm the genetic identity and species of origin of individual cell lines.

NATP | NAT1 | PMID: 16416399 | Mutations in NAT2 leading to the so-called slow-acetylation phenotype reach high frequencies worldwide, which questions the significance of altered acetylation in human adaptation. To investigate the role of population history and natural selection in shaping NATs variation, we characterized genetic diversity through the resequencing and genotyping of NAT1, NAT2, and the pseudogene NATP in a collection of 13 different populations with distinct ethnic backgrounds and demographic pasts. This combined study design allowed us to define a detailed map of linkage disequilibrium of the NATs region as well as to perform a number of sequence-based neutrality tests and the long-range haplotype (LRH) test.

HLA-J | HLA-A | PMID: 16236759 | In all three populations, we observed high levels of nucleotide variation, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, and a genealogy with two common haplotypes separated by deep branches, features that are suggestive of balancing selection acting in this region. Comparisons to HLA-A and a pseudogene, HLA-J, suggested that the observed pattern of sequence variation in the HLA-G promoter region is not likely due to other selected HLA genes. We suggest that the mechanism for this selection is related to the highly regulated expression pattern of HLA-G and that high- and low-expressing promoters may be favored under temporally and/or spatially varying selective pressures.

NAPSB | CASP1 | PMID: 16162398 | For example, the genes encoding PRSS33/EOS, a macrophage serine protease conserved in most mammals, and GGTLA1 are absent in chimpanzee, while the gene for metalloprotease MMP23A, located in chromosome 1p36, has been specifically duplicated in the human genome together with its neighbor gene CDC2L1. Other differences arise from single nucleotide changes in protease genes, such as NAPSB and CASP12, resulting in the presence of functional genes in chimpanzee and pseudogenes in human. Finally, we have confirmed that the Trypanosoma lytic factor HPR is inactive in chimpanzee, likely contributing to the susceptibility of chimpanzees to T.

MBL1P | MBL2 | PMID: 16115813 | In man, the MBL genetic system comprises one functional gene (MBL2) and one expressed pseudogene (MBL1P1), whereas the lower primate, the rhesus monkey resembles rodents with two functional MBL genes. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the evolutionary loss of MBL expression from lower primates to man, including silencing of the MBL1P1 gene and the generation of MBL2 variant structural alleles and promoter polymorphisms leading to the present human MBL2 haplotypes. We present data showing that the MBL1P1 gene has been repeatedly hit throughout evolution and silenced eventually by mutations in the glycine residues of the collagen-like region.

The sequence organization of the gene array is C4A-CYP21P/CYP21-TNXB, whereas chimera TNXA/TNXB is caused by a CYP21 deletion, and a partial TNXB replaced by the TNXA gene shows the C4A-CYP21P-TNXA/TNXB sequence. Therefore, chimeras CYP21P/CYP21 and TNXA/TNXB are two distinct hybrid genes produced in the RCCX module in HLA class III.

ABCC13 | ABCC2 | PMID: 15203202 | On chromosome 21q11.2, spanning 90 kb, is an ABC gene-like sequence (recently annotated as ABCC13) with the highest similarity to ABCC2. Here we show that while comparative analysis and in silico prediction methods indicate the presence of at least 28 exons, the major ABCC13 transcript in humans consists of only 6 exons with a total length of 1.

CYP4Z2P | CYP4Z1 | PMID: 15059886 | Moreover, a transcribed pseudogene CYP4Z2P that codes for a truncated CYP protein (340 amino acids) with 96% identity to CYP4Z1 was found in SK-BR-3. CYP4Z1 and CYP4Z2P genes consisting of 12 exons are localized in head-to-head orientation on chromosome 1p33. Tissue-specific expression was investigated using real-time reverse transcription PCR with normalized cDNA from 18 different human tissues.

CYP4Z2P | CYP4Z1 | PMID: 15059886 | Investigation of cDNA pairs from tumor/normal tissues obtained from 241 patients, including 50 breast carcinomas, confirmed the breast-restricted expression and showed a clear overexpression in 52% of breast cancer samples. The expression profile of CYP4Z2P was similar to that of CYP4Z1 with preference in breast carcinoma and mammary gland but a lower expression level in general. Immunoblot analyses with a specific antiserum for CYP4Z1 clearly demonstrated protein expression in mammary gland and breast carcinoma tissue specimens as well as in CYP4Z1-transduced cell lines.

BAGE2 | TPTE | PMID: 12909339 | The 1.5-Mb proximal domain: (i) is a patchwork of chromosome duplications; (ii) shares sequence similarity with several chromosomes; (iii) contains several gene fragments (truncated genes having an intron/exon structure) intermingled with retrotransposed pseudogenes; and (iv) harbours two genes (TPTE and BAGE2) that belong to gene families and have a cancer and/or testis expression profile. The TPTE gene family was generated before the branching of Old World monkeys from the great ape lineage, by intra- and interchromosome duplications of the ancestral TPTE gene mapping to phylogenetic chromosome XIII.

NATP | NAT1 | PMID: 12595154 | org Arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzymes catalyze the addition of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to a terminal nitrogen on a suitable substrate such as environmentally relevant compounds and pharmaceuticals. In human, there are two highly polymorphic active allozymes, NAT1 and -2, and one inactive pseudogene, NATP. The expression of these enzymes is tissue-specific such that NAT1 is ubiquitously expressed and NAT2 is confined mainly to liver and colorectal tissues.

ABCC13 | ABCC2 | PMID: 12445816 | The amino acid sequence corresponding to putative membrane-spanning domains was remarkably similar to ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, and ABCC6. The ABCC13 gene was expressed in the fetal liver at the highest level among the organs studied. While ABCC13 was expressed in the bone marrow, its expression in peripheral blood leukocytes of adult humans was much lower and no detectable levels were observed in differentiated hematopoietic cells. The expression of ABCC13 in K562 cells decreased during cell differentiation induced by TPA.

Furthermore, MORF4 was heterozygous in these lines. These results question whether MORF4 is the chromosome 4 mortality gene.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 12354783 | The typical number of repeats of the CYP21/C4 region is two, with one repeat carrying CYP21A2 and the other carrying the highly homologous pseudogene CYP21A1P. By comparison with this standard, three categories of CYP21A2 defects have traditionally been distinguished: CYP21A2 deletions, large-scale gene conversions of CYP21A2 into a structure similar to CYP21A1P, and smaller mutations in CYP21A2 (also derived from CYP21A1P, by means of small-scale gene conversions). The genetic mechanisms suggested by these designations have originally been inferred from the layout of the haplotypes involved and were later confirmed by observation of deletions and small mutations, but not large-scale conversions, as de novo events.

CYP21A1P | CYP21A2 | PMID: 12354783 | Currently available data on the structure of 'deletion' and 'large-scale conversion' chromosomes strongly suggests that both are the result of the same mechanism, namely unequal meiotic crossover. Since it is unlikely that the term 'large-scale gene conversion' describes a mechanism that actually occurs between the CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P genes, we propose the discontinuation of that terminology.

CYP2D7 | CYP2D6 | PMID: 11779102 | Investigation of the role of CYP2D6 mRNA for expression and the possibility of using mRNA expression as a surrogate marker has been hampered by the presence of two pseudogenes, CYP2D7P and CYP2D8P. We therefore developed highly specific TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assays for the discriminative quantification of CYP2D6 and CYP2D7/8P transcripts. By in vitro transcription of plasmids containing the CYP2D6 cDNA or a hybrid CYP2D6/7 cDNA constructed by in vitro mutagenesis, authentic cRNAs were synthesized to be used for specificity testing and for absolute quantification.

DHFRP1 | SS18 | PMID: 11435705 | Through sequence and mutation analyses this gene could be excluded as a candidate gene for 3p21-associated renal cell cancer. In addition, we created a detailed BAC map around the human SS18 gene, placing it unequivocally between the CA-repeat marker AFMc014wf9 and the dihydrofolate reductase pseudogene DHFRP1. The next gene in this map, located distal to SS18, was found to be the TBP associated factor TAFII-105 (TAF2C2).

TUBG1P | TUBG2 | PMID: 10903841 | Despite the central role of gamma-tubulin in the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, the gamma-tubulin gene family in humans has not been characterized. We now report the identification of a second expressed human gamma-tubulin gene (TUBG2) and a gamma-tubulin pseudogene (TUBG1P) in addition to the previously identified gamma-tubulin gene (TUBG1). Evidence from Southern hybridizations suggests that there are probably no additional gamma-tubulin sequences in the human genome.

In addition to the UGT2B7 gene, this PAC contains two other UGT2B genes previously characterized, namely UGT2B26P and UGT2B27P. The UGT2B7 gene is composed of six exons spanning approximately 16 kb, with introns ranging from 0.

NBR2 | NBR1 | PMID: 10205276 | Characterization of associations between polymorphic sites located throughout the approximately 200-400-kb variable-length region spanning RNU2-BRCA1 reveals nearly complete linkage disequilibrium. This segment spans the RNU2 array, which includes 6-30 tandem copies of the U2 snRNA gene, and an adjacent region containing NBR1, the LBRCA1 pseudogene, NBR2, and BRCA1 in a tandemly duplicated structure. A series of biallelic polymorphisms define two common haplotypes that do not vary significantly, in structure or frequency, between populations of primarily European (n=275) or Asian (n=34) ancestry.

TNXA | RP2 | PMID: 10207042 | As shown by definitive RFLPs, the tandemly arranged genes RP, C4, CYP21, and TNX are duplicated together as a discrete genetic unit termed the RCCX module. Duplications of the RCCX modules occurred by the addition of genomic fragments containing a long (L) or a short (S) C4 gene, a CYP21A or a CYP21B gene, and the gene fragments TNXA and RP2. Four major RCCX structures with bimodular L-L, bimodular L-S, monomodular L, and monomodular S are present in the Caucasian population.

TNXA | TNXB | PMID: 10207042 | The RCCX modular variations appear to be a root cause for the acquisition of deleterious mutations from pseudogenes or gene segments in the RCCX to their corresponding functional genes. In a patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, we discovered a TNXB-TNXA recombinant with the deletion of RP2-C4B-CYP21B. Elucidation of the DNA sequence for the recombination breakpoint region and sequence analyses yielded definitive proof for an unequal crossover between TNXA from a bimodular chromosome and TNXB from a monomodular chromosome.

The RCCX modular variations in gene number and gene size contributed to unequal crossovers and exchanges of polymorphic sequences/mutations, resulting in the homogenization of C4 polymorphisms and acquisitions of deleterious mutations in RP1, C4A, C4B, CYP21B and TNXB genes. RD, SKI2W, DOM3Z and RP1 are the four novel genes found between Bf and C4.

NBR2 | BRCA1 | PMID: 9215675 | uk To study the regulation of BRCA1 gene expression and the potential importance of dysregulation of this gene in breast and ovarian cancer, we have examined the 5' region of the human BRCA1 gene in detail. We have identified a new gene, NBR2, which is partially related to the NBR1 gene (formerly known as 1A1-3B and mapping directly adjacent to the pseudo-BRCA1 gene) and which lies head to head with the BRCA1 gene. The physical distance between the transcription start sites of the NBR2 and BRCA1 genes is 218 bp, suggesting that regulation of the expression of both genes may be co-ordinated through a bi-directional promoter.

Variant c was derived from CYP2D6, variants d, e, and b were from CYP2D7P, and variant b' and full-length mRNA were derived from both CYP2D6 and 2D7P. Full-length mRNA was a minor form in human breast tissue where variants b' and c predominated.

CYP2D7 | CYP2D6 | PMID: 9205060 | Allelic variants of the CYP2D6 gene, a member of the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily, have been implicated in susceptibility to lung carcinogenesis. Human breast CYP2D6 and CYP2D7P (from a pseudogene) mRNAs were previously reported to be expressed as a series of splice variants. In this study, the expression of full-length and splice variants of these mRNAs in human lung tissue and tumors are reported for the first time and are compared in order to probe the potential for differential CYP2D6 regulation in lung normal tissue and tumors.

Five functional genes (CST1-CST5) and two pseudogenes (CSTP1 and CSTP2) have previously been cloned. We have developed a panel of short genomic fragments that serve as gene-specific probes for these seven genes under hybridization conditions used for Southern blots or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Analysis of BssHII-digested genomic DNA using these probes was consistent with association of all seven genes with a 905-kb fragment, suggesting physical clustering at a single site.

Analysis of BssHII-digested genomic DNA using these probes was consistent with association of all seven genes with a 905-kb fragment, suggesting physical clustering at a single site.

CALCP | CALCB | PMID: 8468047 | Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We report the high-resolution localization of the human calcitonin/CGRP genes, CALCA, CALCB, and the pseudogene CALCP, to a 220-kb SacII fragment on chromosome 11p15.2-p15.

RAF1P1 | QDPR | PMID: 8096345 | Fifty-seven polymorphisms, representing 42 loci, were analyzed in the Venezuelan reference pedigree. The markers included seven genes (ADRA2C, ALB, GABRB1, GC, HOX7, IDUA, QDPR), one pseudogene (RAF1P1), and 34 anonymous DNA loci. Four loci were represented by microsatellite polymorphisms and one (GC) was expressed as a protein polymorphism.

HLA-H | HLA-A | PMID: 1362179 | This originally manifested itself as a haplotype-associated size variation in the NotI and MluI megabase fragments observed on pulsed-field electrophoresis gels after blotting and probing with HLA-A subregion-specific genomic probes. The contracted region falls between the HLA-A and the HLA-G class I genes and specifically includes the novel HLA-A-related pseudogene, HLA-H, as well as the adjacent deteriorated class I pseudogene, 7.0 p.

HLA-J | HLA-A | PMID: 1602142 | G. Ragoussis and co-workers (Genomics 4:301) previously described a class I HLA gene (now designated HLA-J) that maps to within 50 kb of HLA-A. The nucleotide sequences of three HLA-J alleles are reported here.

HLA-J | HLA-G | PMID: 1602142 | The nucleotide sequences of three HLA-J alleles are reported here. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of HLA-J alleles shows this gene is more related to HLA-G, A, and H than to HLA-B, C, E, and F. All four alleles of HLA-J are pseudogenes because of deleterious mutations that produce translation termination either in exon 2 or exon 4.

HLA-J | HLA-B | PMID: 1602142 | Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of HLA-J alleles shows this gene is more related to HLA-G, A, and H than to HLA-B, C, E, and F. All four alleles of HLA-J are pseudogenes because of deleterious mutations that produce translation termination either in exon 2 or exon 4. Apart from these mutations, the predicted proteins have structures similar to those of HLA-A, B, and C molecules.

HLA-H | HLA-A | PMID: 1602142 | There is, however, little polymorphism at HLA-J and none at functional positions of the Ag-recognition site. The polymorphism is less than found for HLA-H another HLA-A-related pseudogene. HLA-J appears, like HLA-H, to be an inactivated gene that result from duplication of an Ag-presenting locus related to HLA-A.

CSTP2 | CST5 | PMID: 1334620 | The CST4 clone contained the gene coding for the precursor form(141 amino acids) of cystatin S, and its exon-intron organization is the same as that of other members (the cystatin SN gene at the CST1 locus, the cystatin SA gene at the CST2 locus, the cystatin C gene at the CST3 locus and a cystatin pseudogene at the CSTP1 locus). The second cystatin pseudogene was elucidated in the clone, CST5, and it was assigned to the CSTP2 locus. Alignment of DNA sequences of cystatin genes with other genes suggested that the genes for cystatins, kininogens, and Bowman-Birk type inhibitors have evolved from an ancient ribonuclease-like gene. PMID: 1334620  [Indexed for MEDLINE] 6441.

HLA-H | HLA-B | PMID: 2294403 | A portion of this RNA begins at the transcription site predicted by analogy to certain class I cDNA clones, while another portion appears to begin shortly upstream. L cells transfected with a hybrid gene containing the first three exons of HLA-H and the last five exons of HLA-B27 accumulated full-length HLA transcripts at the same level as cells transfected with an HLA-B27 gene; both levels are at least 15- to 20-fold higher than that directed by HLA-H alone. In addition, we isolated a cDNA clone for HLA-H that contains a portion of intron 3 attached to a normally spliced sequence comprising exons 4 through 8.

MT2P1 | HP | PMID: 2873080 | In an earlier paper, positive but nonsignificant lod scores were found in pair-wise linkage tests between multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN-2A) and both the haptoglobin (HP) locus on chromosome 16 and group-specific component (GC) locus on chromosome 4. Recently discovered restriction fragment length polymorphisms for HP and for metallothionein 2 processed pseudogene 1 (MT2P1) near GC have made it possible to carry out a more powerful set of linkage tests with MEN-2A. This paper reports the results of such linkage analyses employing both pair-wise and multipoint tests.

MT2P1 | GC | PMID: 2873080 | Close linkage of HP on chromosome 16 and MEN-2A is excluded. Linkage of MEN-2A on chromosome 4 with GC is excluded on the MT2P1 side of GC in a 7-centimorgan interval around MT2P1. DOI: 10.
